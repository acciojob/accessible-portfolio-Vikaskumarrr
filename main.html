		<p id=p1>Quick question: When was the last time you purchased something online? Yesterday? This morning? Ok, cool. So when do you think you’ll next purchase something online? Tomorrow? Tonight? No shame—me too.

And we’re not alone. Last year, 80% of Americans shopped online at least monthly, and 5% were shopping online daily, Big Commerce reported. For many of us, online shopping has become a routine part of daily life, with huge impact on a global scale. Global ecommerce sales have skyrocketed over the last four years: According to Statista, in 2014, annual online sales totalled $1.3 billion USD worldwide; by last year, they’d doubled to $2.8 billion; and by 2021, they’re expected to nearly double again to $4.48 billion. That’s 17.5% of retail sales worldwide.</p>
